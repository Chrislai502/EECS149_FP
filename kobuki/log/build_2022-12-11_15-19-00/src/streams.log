[0.080s] CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
[0.080s]   No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
[0.080s]   contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
[0.080s]   code such as
[0.081s] 
[0.081s]     project(ProjectName)
[0.081s] 
[0.081s]   near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().
[0.081s] 
[0.081s]   CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
[0.082s]   line.
[0.082s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[0.104s] CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:1 (add_subdirectory):
[0.104s]   The source directory
[0.104s] 
[0.105s]     /home/lfvmu/kobuki/src/ecl_core
[0.105s] 
[0.105s]   does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.
[0.105s] 
[0.105s]   CMake does not support this case but it used to work accidentally and is
[0.106s]   being allowed for compatibility.
[0.106s] 
[0.106s]   Policy CMP0014 is not set: Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.  Run
[0.106s]   "cmake --help-policy CMP0014" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
[0.106s]   command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
[0.107s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[0.107s] CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
[0.107s]   No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as
[0.107s] 
[0.108s]     cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
[0.108s] 
[0.108s]   should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
[0.108s]   if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
[0.108s]   information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
[0.109s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
