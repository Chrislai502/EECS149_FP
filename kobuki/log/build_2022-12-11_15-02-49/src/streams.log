[0.150s]   No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
[0.150s]   contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of

[0.151s]     project(ProjectName)
[0.151s] 
[0.151s]   near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

[0.152s]   CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
[0.152s]   line.
[0.152s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
